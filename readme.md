# Sentinel Social Addon

[![Build Status](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/svg/31)](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/view/31)

Sentinel Social is a `Sentinel` addon that makes authenticating your users through social networks & third-party OAuth providers in Sentinel an absolute breeze.

The package requires PHP 5.4+ and comes bundled with a Laravel 4 Facade and a Service Provider to simplify the optional framework integration and follows the FIG standard PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code and is fully unit-tested.

Part of the Cartalyst Arsenal & licensed [Cartalyst PSL](license.txt). Code well, rock on.
